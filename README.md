# Pinebook Pro keyboard/touchpad firmware updater

This application does upgrade firmware of the built-in keyboard and touchpad.

## Compiling

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackhumbert/pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
cd pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev xxd
make
```

On Arch/Manjaro:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/jackhumbert/pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
cd pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
sudo pacman -Syy base-devel libusb vim
make
```

## Pick right keyboard model

Pinebook Pro offers two keyboard types: `iso` and `ansi`.

Append your model type after the `step-1` or `step-2` command specifying `iso` or `ansi`.

**In order to update with `ansi` keyboard the external keyboard will be required as for the duration of the process the keyboard will stop working.**

## Update all firmware images

You need to do all of that in correct order,
if at any point process fails, start it from point 1.:

1. Run `step-1 iso` or `step-1 ansi` of update process: `sudo ./updater step-1 iso`,
1. After `step-1 iso` or `step-1 ansi` touchpad **will not work**, keyboard works as normal (this is true only for **ISO**, the **ANSI** keyboard will not work after `step-1`),
1. Power your Pinebook Pro off with `sudo poweroff` and then power it on again,
1. After booting up, run `step-2 iso` or `step-2 ansi` of update process: `sudo ./updater step-2`,
1. Power your Pinebook Pro off with `sudo poweroff` and then power it on again,
1. After booting up, your keyboard and touchpad firmware should be updated.

### Revised firmware

There has been some effort in [`firmware/`](firmware/) to reverse engineer and customise the existing firmware, fixing some of the common issues people are facing. **Currently you need to flash this after steps 1 and 2 with a separate command**, `flash-kb` followed by the `.hex` file location. No power cycling is required after flashing, but may be needed if your keyboard/touchpad is unresponsive (currently rare). Source code for each version can be found in [`firmware/src/`](firmware/src/).

```bash
# compile
git clone https://github.com/jackhumbert/pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
cd pinebook-pro-keyboard-updater
sudo apt-get install build-essential libusb-1.0-0-dev xxd 
make

# For ISO keyboard
# step-1
sudo ./updater step-1 iso
sudo poweroff

# Turn your Pinebook Pro on again, then run step-2
sudo ./updater step-2 iso
sudo poweroff

# For ANSI keyboard
# step-1
sudo ./updater step-1 ansi
sudo poweroff

# Turn your Pinebook Pro on again, then run step-2
sudo ./updater step-2 ansi
sudo poweroff

# updating to the revised ansi firmware after steps 1 and 2
sudo ./updater flash-kb firmware/default_ansi.hex

# updating to the revised iso firmware after steps 1 and 2
sudo ./updater flash-kb firmware/default_iso.hex

```
